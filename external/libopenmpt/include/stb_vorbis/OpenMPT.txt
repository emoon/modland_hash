commit 8e51be04dc7dcee462e1f09e410faceab52cc6d2 (2021-07-02)

Modifications:
 *  Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and
    fails to compile.
 *  Macro redefinition of alloca with mingw-w64 has been fixed.
 *  Macro redefinition of STB_VORBIS_NO_STDIO has been fixed.
