 *  Portaudio git commit 799a6834a58592eadc5712cba73b35956dc51579 (2020-03-26)
 *  `build/msvc/portaudio.def` has been modified. Modifications are marked with
    `;OpenMPT`.
 *  `src/hostapi/dsound/pa_win_ds.c` unconditionally defined `_WIN32_WINNT`.
    Only define it if it has not been defined already. Modifications have been
    marked with `// OpenMPT`.
 *  A small modification to portaudio code has been made in
    `src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c` to facilitate linking against
    `strmiids.lib`. Modifications have been marked with `// OpenMPT`.
 *  Non-fatal assertions in `src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c` concerning pin
    conections which trigger with some Windows 10 drivers have been removed.
 *  `src/os/win/pa_x86_plain_converters.c` has been modified to exclude inline
    asm for non-x86 platforms. Modifications have been marked with `// OpenMPT`.
 *  A couple of unnecessary folders have been omitted in SVN:
    bindings, cmake_support, doc, examples, pablio, test, testcvs
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
    > NOTE: Various versions of the Windows SDK (such as the one provided with
    > the VS2008 x64 compiler) do not provide ksguid.lib. To simplify the build
    > configuration, PA_WDMKS_NO_KSGUID_LIB is defined in the premake projects
    > to always use PortAudio's workaround, regardless of the compiler version
    > used.
 *  Unnecssary files have been removed.
